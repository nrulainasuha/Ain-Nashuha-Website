        <h2>Go hiking to Broga hill in Selangor</h2>
        <h5>2013</h5>
        <center><img src="image/Broga hill.jpg"></center>
        <p>At that time my primary school, asked all grade 6 students to get involved with our last activity which was the hill climbing activity. For me it was my first experience climbing a hill that for me was high and also tiring because I had never climbed a hill that high. So we were all instructed to sleep overnight at school and move the next morning after the dawn prayers. After that we traveled by school bus and traveled to reach the destination for 2 hours if I'm not mistaken. Once we arrived our teachers gave instructions and we were ready to climb.
           After half of my climb, I just remembered I forgot to bring my mineral water. During the climb I saw some of my  friends vomiting, some showed their reaction was very tired and so on. I myself was also very tired on almost half of my climb. Since I’m big so that’s a bit of interfering with my movements. I saw some  also reached the top and there were some of my other friends who were still sitting  and not moving because they are so tired. At that time I was very tired and almost vomited and also my body was not strong enough to climb again. Suddenly teacher Tajul  helped me and some of my friends by holding our bags to reduce the burden on ourselves. He gave us encouragement to get to the top and thanks to his help, finally me and some of my friends managed to get to the top part of broga hill. That was my bittersweet experience, which I will remember until today</p>

        <h2>Experience being a netball player</h2>
        <h5>2012-2018</h5>
        <center><img src="image/Netball 1.jpg"></center>
        <p>So in primary school I was able to represent the school for 2 years only and we participated in the MSSD Petaling Perdana netball competition and thank God, our school SK Hicom won third place in the MSSD netball competition in 2012 and that was a very happy moment for me because the first time I entered a competition and our school was able to win 3rd place for the sport. It is even more gratifying when in 2013 SK Hicom managed to become the Champion of the MSSD Petaling Perdana netball team where we were able to win the trophy at our own school because my school was the host for MSSD that year.We are very thankful for the result of our hard work, our efforts, thank God we managed to win it
           Once I entered middle school, my performance was a little slow compared to primary school because in middle school we had to training on our own because, we didn’t have a coach like in my primary school. So I participated in netball in form 1 to 5 however, our school only had time to play 3 competitions while 2 more competitions we did not play because there was a misunderstanding between the school and our teachers, because we could not budget to go compete. At that time we were all sad, disappointed because we were ready to compete and we had given our time for training, but when the competition date was near, our teacher told us that SMK Seksyen 27 could not enter the competition. That's the thing I'm very upset about.Maybe we don’t have the fortune to play in those 2 years, but it’s okay because we can still compete in those 3 years</p>
